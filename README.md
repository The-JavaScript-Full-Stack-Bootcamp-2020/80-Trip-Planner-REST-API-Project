The JavaScript Full-Stack Bootcamp: LEVEL 18 REST API (Lesson 80)

We created a REST API using Node.js and Express. This API uses set of GET and POST endpoints to allow us to get data out, and sending data in. We also use a MongoDB database to store this data.

Our goal is to create a trip cost calculator app. Imagine going on a trip, and you have your app (which can be a progressive web app, or a mobile app for example) where you add any expense you make. Gasoline, hotels, food, tickets and so on. When the trip ends, you archive it and it becomes part of the history - which you can navigate and see how much you spent in the past trips.

We don't create the frontend of the application here, just the API.
